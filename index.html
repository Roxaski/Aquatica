                    <p>The Great Barrier Reef is located in the Coral Sea, which is situated in Australia's northeastern coast. It's truly an incredible site to behold, and it's home to the world's largest collection of coral reefs.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately however the Great Coral Reef is in danger of extinction, due to changes in the waters temperatures along with poor ocean water quality, which is partly because of pollution and the many changes in our climate over the years.</p>

                    <p>Everyone can make a change by reducing their carbon emissions, and by being respectful of the marine life that inhabits the coral reefs.</p>

                    <h2>Home to marine life</h2>

                    <p>The Great Barrier Reef is also the home of over one thousand different species of fish, as well as being home to many different species of coral.</p>

                    <p>Over 400 species of coral can be found at the Great Barrier Reef, and they benefit provide a variety of benefits to the enviroment such as providing a habitat for marine life, helping to mitigate climate change and helping to maintain water quality, by filtrating carbon monoxide.</p>

                    <p>As you can see this wonderful place is important to the preservation of our ocean, and you can help to make a change.</p>

                        <p>Our oceans ecosystem is incredibly important not only to the ocean but to our world as a whole. Coral reefs are the rainforests of the oceanic world, ocean plankton that help to keep to not only marine ecology but also play a vital role in our worlds carbon and oxygen production.</p>
        
                        <p>All of the marine life plays a role in the ocean, and it's so important to keep them all safe. Sea turtles contribute to the ecosystem by spreading seeds and grazing the saegrass beds, some sharks for example transfer nutrients from deep to shallow waters which in turn helps areas that aren't has rich in nutrients.</p>
        
                        <p>Every marine life plays an imporant role to the oceans ecosystem.</p>

                    <p>Fishing is one of the worlds largest industries, and it is indeed a very important part of our lives, as fish provide a variety of nutrients, protein and omega-3. But issues start to arise when we fish start to get depleted faster than they can repopulate, which can lead to a wide range of issues, which can eventually even lead to them being a part of the endagered or extintct list.</p>

                    <p>This causes even further issues, where boats inadvertently catch other fish that they aren't procuring which in turn get discarded, and all this can lead to issues with other population of marine life that rely on certain fish to survive and thrive.</p>

                    <p>Ocean is a serious issue that affects not only marine life but us too, as it causes not only waste to wash ashore to our beaches, but it also can cause chemical pollution in the ocean, which is detremental to us as a whole but also to all the marine that inhabit the oceans.</p>

                    <p>You may not know this but millions of rubbish washes ashore every year. It's imporant to be aware of this, so that we can not only keep our beaches safe and clean but to ensure that sea life like turtles and seals, don't get tangled up in rubbish which can cause serious harm to them.</p>

                    <p>Keep the beaches clean, always pick the your rubbish and put it in the bin.</p>
